# Rules 
At certain levels, you gain access to the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using this rule, you can forgo the Ability Score Improvement and take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.
You must meet the prerequisites specified in a feat to take that feat. If you were to lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

Any feat from 2014 Players Handbook, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, and/or Xanathar's Guide to Everything
