# Rules for Character Creation
For character creation, your character must adhere to the following rules. The DM has the final interpretation of these rules.
1. Characters must be willing to be part of an adventuring group and work with other PCs. Concepts that require a PC to be a "lone wolf" must still abide by this rule.
2. Evil PCs are not allowed
	1.  This does not mean that you must be a "good" character. You cannot be outright evil.
3. Classes, races, spells, backgrounds, [[Feats|feats]], or other character components must be from the 2014 Players Handbook, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and/or Monsters of the Multiverse.
	1. Races cannot have a fly speed
	2. DM reserve the right to ban certain builds even if they are technically published (ie. **NO** cheese builds).
	3. DM reserves the right to ban any character components if it is believed to not fit the world or campaign.
4. All characters will be created using [[Point Buy]]. If any aspect of your character requires rolling (eg Hit Points), the DM must be present.
5. **ALL** aspects of your character must be approved during Session 0/before play. You must be willing to explain your character to the DM - you are allowed to have secrets from the party, but not the DM. Any character change (including backstory) after play has begun must be discussed with the DM prior to implementing the change.
6. Characters are allowed/encouraged to have shared backstories and prior associations with each other. Multiple similar PCs are discouraged - work with your fellow players on bringing a unique character to the group.

## Additional Notes
You are allowed to research character builds, concepts, etc and work on putting a character together for a session 0 - this includes using the [[Point Buy]] for stats (calculations must be shown if done prior to session 0).

If you need help coming up with a character, the DM will help you. If you already have an idea, that's fine, but the DM requires 100% disclosure and *approval*. 

Remember, if a character is vetoed by the DM, there is good reason for it. "Cool" doesn't mean it's a good idea.

Basically: No PC reaches the table without the DM knowing everything and approval.
