# Advise for Character Creation 
Character creation can be difficult and feel like a daunting task. So here is some of the resources that I like and think is very good advice

## Question Your Character 
When creating a character, you should question your character as a way to build and get to know your character. Look up questions to ask or use some of the questions and resources below:
- Why does your character adventure?
- What are you character's goals?

## Personal Connections (Bonds)
Creating a bond between you and some other person is a great way to have an "in" to the world. That bond could be family members, friends, another PC, a random NPC (that you create - yes you could create your own NPC to be connected - or one that I've already made). Bonds can be good or bad. Did you have a childhood bully? Did someone kill your significant other? Did your professor teach you how to use magic? All of these could be used as a personal connection.
