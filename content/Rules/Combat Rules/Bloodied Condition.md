## Mechanic
When a character or creature loses half their hit points (rounded down) they are considered bloodied. The character/creature doesn't gain or lose any abilities but the creature visual appears is covered in blood. This is a way to indicate an in character way to discuss hit points as well as show had far you are in a battle with an enemy.
