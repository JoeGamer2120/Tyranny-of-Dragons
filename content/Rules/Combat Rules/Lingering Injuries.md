# Lingering Injuries Rule
During combat, when a character is dropped to 0 hit points, the character must make constitution saving throw of DC 10 or half the damage sustained, whichever is higher. On a failed roll, the player rolls a d20 to find out what injury occurs. Some damage types don't make sense with the injury table I've made and so may not apply (up to DM discretion) These injuries may not be as easy to heal has just standard hit points and may require more powerful healing than a simple cure wounds or potion of healing.
This rule is modified from the DMG

## Why?
This rule is my attempt to fix an issue I have with 5e combat and encourage roleplay when characters sustain lingering injuries. My issue with 5e combat is it can sometimes feel there is no need to heal characters/creatures until they are at 0 hit points or have it so players just take short/long rest to *quickly* heal up. Lingering injuries introduce another *avoidable* but consequential condition for the players.
