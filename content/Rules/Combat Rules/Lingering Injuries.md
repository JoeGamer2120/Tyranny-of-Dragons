# Lingering Injuries Rule
During combat, when a character is dropped to 0 hit points, the character must make constitution saving throw of DC 10 or half the damage sustained, whichever is higher. On a failed roll, the player rolls a d20 to find out what injury occurs. Some damage types don't make sense with the injury table I've made and so may not apply (up to DM discretion) These injuries may not be as easy to heal has just standard hit points and may require more powerful healing than a simple cure wounds or potion of healing.
This rule is modified from the DMG

## Why?
This rule is my attempt to fix an issue I have with 5e combat and encourage roleplay when characters sustain lingering injuries. My issue with 5e combat is it can sometimes feel there is no need to heal characters/creatures until they are at 0 hit points or have it so players just take short/long rest to *quickly* heal up. Lingering injuries introduce another *avoidable* but consequential condition for the players.

## Injury Table
DMG

| d20   | Injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded.                                                                 |
| 2     | **Lose an Arm or a Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.                                                                                                                          |
| 3     | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity check made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 4     | **Limp.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. you must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.                                                                                                                      |
| 5-7   | **Internal Injury.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of you next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.      |
| 8-10  | **Broken Ribs.** this has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
