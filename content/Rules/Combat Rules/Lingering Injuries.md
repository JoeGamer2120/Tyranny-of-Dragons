# Lingering Injuries Rule
During combat, when a character is dropped to 0 hit points, the character must make constitution saving throw of DC 10 or half the damage sustained, whichever is higher. On a failed roll, the player rolls a d20 to find out what injury occurs. Some damage types don't make sense with the injury table I've made and so may not apply (up to DM discretion) These injuries may not be as easy to heal has just standard hit points and may require more powerful healing than a simple cure wounds or potion of healing.
This rule is modified from the DMG

## Why?
This rule is my attempt to fix an issue I have with 5e combat and encourage roleplay when characters sustain lingering injuries. My issue with 5e combat is it can sometimes feel there is no need to heal characters/creatures until they are at 0 hit points or have it so players just take short/long rest to *quickly* heal up. Lingering injuries introduce another *avoidable* but consequential condition for the players.

| 1   | Fatal Injury          | The creature suffers a deadly injury with significant trauma such as ruptured lung, a pierced heart or similar. If the creature is still conscious after the triggering attack, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 20), on a failure they drop to 0 hit points and are dying. They must repeat this saving throw at the start of their next turn. You do not make another Injury check if this effect causes a creature to drop to 0 hit points. Until this injury is removed the creature has disadvantage on death saving throws, cannot be stabilized and cannot regain hit points. If another creature spends 1 minute doing nothing but tending to the injured creature with a healers kit or casting Heal Greater Injury on them, any death saving throws made do not take effect. If the creature is stopped from helping for any reason, the death saving throws take immediate effect. At the end of the minute, the aiding creature can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, on a success, the injury is healed and the injured creature stabilizes if it was dying. On a failure, all death saving throws immediately take effect. | 20          | Greater                |
| 2   | Pierced Lung          | One of the creature's lungs, or similar organ, has been pierced or badly damaged. The creature finds it difficult to breath (if it needs air) and at the start of their next turn they begin to choke on fluids in its system. (See rules for choking, under suffocating, in the Players Handbook). To heal this injury requires the fluids to be drained from the creature's lung first. This can be done with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of 15 and allows the creature to breathe for a number of minutes equal to their constitution modifier. To completely heal this injury without magic, a second Wisdom (Medicine) check of 18 can be made during a short rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 18          | Greater                |
| 3   | Lost Limb             | One of the creaturesâ€™ limbs is permanently lost or so badly damaged to the point that it no longer functions. Either the GM chooses the limb based on the situation, or roll a die (1d4 for a creature with form limbs, etc). 1 - Right Arm. 2 - Left Arm. 3 - Right Leg. 4 - Left Leg. A creature with a lost leg cannot walk unassisted and can only crawl 10ft. A lost arm cannot be used to attack with. If the creature has 1 or more hit points remaining after the injury, they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) on a failure their hit points immediately drop to 0. You do not make another Injury check if this effect causes a creature to drop to 0 hit points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | N/A         | Regenerate             |
| 4   | Lost Eye              | One of the creatures' eyes is permanently blinded. They have Disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight, as well as Ranged attacks. If all the creature's eyes are maimed, they are blinded permanently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N/A         | Regenerate             |
| 5   | Gaping Wound          | The creature suffers a terrible cut, or other injuries, that causes massive blood loss. At the start of each turn, the creature loses hit points equal to a quarter of its maximum hit points. If the creature attacks or casts a spell with a casting time of one action, they lose 5 hit points. This injury can be temporarily stopped with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of DC 15, or completely healed during a short rest and a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of 20. If only temporarily healed, the injury returns if the creature is knocked Prone, suffers another Injury or falls more than 10ft. A creature cannot be stabilized whilst they have this injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 18          | Greater                |
| 6   | Maimed Jaw            | The creature cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. They cannot eat and can only drink with assistance. They are wracked with terrible pain that causes all attacks, ability checks and saving throws to be made with disadvantage. Spending 1 minute and making a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check can alleviate the pain for 1 hour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 15          | Greater                |
| 7   | Maimed Limb           | One of the creature's limbs is severely injured, either broken or otherwise rendered useless temporarily. Either the GM chooses the limb based on the situation, or roll a die (1d4 for a creature with four limbs, etc). 1 - Right Arm. 2 - Left Arm. 3 - Right Leg. 4 - Left Leg. A creature with a maimed leg cannot walk unassisted and can only move at half speed. A maimed arm cannot be used to attack with. The creature cannot gain the benefits of a short or long rest until a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check is performed on them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 15          | Minor                  |
| 8   | Injured Ribs          | One or several of the creature's ribs are broken or otherwise badly injured, making it difficult to move and breath. A creature with this injury can take only an action or a bonus action, not both. They cannot take the dash action or make opportunity attacks, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws. Spending 1 minute and making a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check can alleviate the pain and remove the disadvantage for 1 hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 15          | Minor                  |
| 9   | Bleeding Wound        | The creature suffers a wound that continues to bleed heavily and normal healing magic is not enough to close it. At the start of their turn, the creature loses hit points equal to their proficiency bonus. This injury can be temporarily stopped with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of DC 10, or completely healed during a short rest and a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of 15. If only temporarily healed, the injury returns if the creature is knocked Prone, suffers another Injury or falls more than 10ft. A creature cannot be stabilized whilst they have this injury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 15          | Minor                  |

# Healing Injuries
On the Injuries Table, each injury has a Medicine check DC and what spell is required to heal the injury. 

Healing an injury without magic may be possible with a Wisdom (Medicine) ability check, but always requires the character attempting it to have a Healerâ€™s Kit and usually takes at least 1 minute of uninterrupted surgery. Healing an injury consumes 1d4 uses from a Healers Kit. Each Injury states specifically if it can be healed with a Wisdom ability check. Some Injuries, a Wisdom (Medicine) check may only provide temporary relief from the injuries lesser effects. 

Certain characters may also learn two spells; Heal Minor Injury and Heal Major Injury, that can specifically complete more intricate healing such as repairing broken bones, grievous cuts and nerve damage. Often a local healer, priest or similar NPC might be able to offer these spells on behalf of the party (provided the costs are supplied), and usually these are done as rituals.
