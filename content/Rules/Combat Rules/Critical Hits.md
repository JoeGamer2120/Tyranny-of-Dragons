## Mechanic
For critical hits (rolling a natural 20 on an *attack roll*), damage will be calculated by adding the maximum damage possible to the rolled damage.
### Example
Player A rolls a 20 on an attack from a shortsword
Normal shortsword damage is 1d6 piercing
Total damage done by Player A would then be 6 + 1d6 + additional modifiers
