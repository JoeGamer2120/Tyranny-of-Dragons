# Welcome to Tyranny of Dragons
This wiki style website is to provide all players a convenient and easy to use lore document. This website will be updated with more information as the summer continues. 

# Using this Website
Everything here can be used to obtain information about the world of [[Faer√ªn]], the world you will be exploring. This is not meant to be a fully compressive guide to world but an overview to help you get a basic idea of the world to create a character. If you have question about anything in specific, reach out and I can help clarify or provide additional information.

## Player vs Character Knowledge
This website is an overview for you the player. Your character may not know all of the information provided. Just because you know it doesn't mean that your character does. If you aren't sure whether your character would know something ask the DM before assuming you do. This is a resource for **YOU**, not your character.

## On the Forgotten Realms Wiki
While this campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms, don't assume that you can use the Forgotten Realms Wiki. It's a great resource but things may slightly vary to fit better with the narrative of the campaign. Be wary of using it for additional information.
Additionally, the Forgotten Realms Wiki could provide spoilers to the campaign. 

# Important Note
This website is being hosted from Github Pages with an associated Github repo. Do **NOT** look at the Github repo as it may contain files that you don't have access to (they have not been published). If they are not on the website, then there is a reason you can't see them.
