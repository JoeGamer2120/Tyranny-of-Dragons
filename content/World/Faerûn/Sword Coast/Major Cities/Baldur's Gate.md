# Government

# City Structure
Baldur's Gate is divided into three section: the Upper City, the Lower City, and the Outer City.
## Upper City
The Upper City radiates with wealth and beauty. The Upper City is home to the noble class. It's home to some notable locations and landmarks, including some lavish places of worship. It is also well guarded by regular patrols

## Lower City 
The Lower City is much larger than the Upper City. It's streets are packed and lined with tall, slender buildings. The Lower City is also full of trade, commerce, and work. While not as well-kept as the Upper City, it was full of life as the average citizen makes their way with no end to the things to do in the Lower City.

## Outer City 
The Outer City is a sprawling, chaotic shantytown that grew outside of the Gate's walls. The Outer City is full of stockyards, shacks, and muddy roads. While technically under the jurisdiction of the Council of Four, city officials have little to do with the unregulated Outer City. The Outer City also contains the jobs that tend to leave a very foul odor like that of a butcher.
