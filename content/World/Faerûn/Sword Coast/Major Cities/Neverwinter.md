# Overview
Located in Sword Coast North, Neverwinter is a major cosmopolitan city in the Sword Coast. It's known for it's craftsfolk and gardeners. Most notably, a volcanic eruption from Mount Hotenow destroyed much of the city 50 years ago and caused a major chasm to open within Neverwinter. The volcano also is where Neverwinter gets its name as the volcano causes Neverwinter to be warm all year round. Compared to other major cities, Neverwinter is poorer than most.

# Government
The government of New Neverwinter (but just called Neverwinter) is an imperialist city ruled by Dagult Neverember. There is not much of an established government outside of the Dagult. Groups of tiny militias tend to defend the streets and make of justice that way. Outside of these militias, the Hall of Justice resides within Neverwinter as a temple to Tyr, who has many followers in Neverwinter. Having such a strong following, the Lord of Justice's teachings are held close to the citizens of Neverwinter.
