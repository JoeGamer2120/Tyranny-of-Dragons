## General Information
The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining the balance in the natural order and combatting forces that poses a threat to it. The Enclave is most well known for it's benevolent deeds and feared for its swift actions against those responsible for crimes against nature. Most of the Enclave's members live in the wilderness or small communities so they have very little representatives in towns and cities. However, they are not opposed to civilization; they seek to prevent civilization and the wilderness from harming one another. Many members of the Emerald Enclave are Druids, rangers, and bards but its numbers are not only made of these classes. It's open to anyone who values the natural order and neutrality.

> [!NOTE] Being a Member of the Enclave
> These tenets doesn't mean that they are always followed. If you play a character who is apart of the Emerald Enclave you don't necessarily have to follow these to a tee. It's up to you on how you play your character and if he/she would follow these Tenets strictly. The reason for stating the tenets is to show what the organization holds, not necessarily your character.
