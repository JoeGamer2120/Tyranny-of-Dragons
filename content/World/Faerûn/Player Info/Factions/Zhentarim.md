## General Information
As known as the Black Network, the Zhentarim are best known by the common folk for providing the *best* guards or mercenaries money can buy no matter how morally ambiguous the cause is. However, at the heart of the Zhentarim is an evil group of leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's  reach into every evil act: assassination, black markets, and illegal drug deals. The Zhentarim have far reaching connection spanning across Faer√ªn. Many members of the Zhentarim are rouges, thieves, assassins and evil wizards and many of its members serve the dark gods Bane and Cyric.
