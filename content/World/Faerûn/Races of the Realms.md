# Common Races
Most, if not all of these races are based in the 2014 Player's Handbook. The Sword Coast Adventure's Guide expands on these races providing more subraces with unique histories tied to the Forgotten Realms and stats that reflect that sub race.
These races are found more often in the lands of [[FaerÃ»n]], hence why these are "common."

> [!NOTE] Picking a Race
> The reason for this list of races is because picking these will make background creation that much easier. These races are already native to the Sword Coast so they will have a tie to the world making you more involved in the world. This is why I **HIGHLY** recommend you pick a common race.
