## General Information
Similar to The Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet wishes to see justice and equality across Faer√ªn however, the methods and attitudes of each faction are very different. Where The Harpers preferred secrecy, bearers of the Gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice. The Order never hides in the shadows. The attitude of the Order is that evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day to embolden others to also fight evil.

## Values & Beliefs
The Order holds three tenets:
- Faith was a member's most potent weapon against evil
- Great challenges required heroic demonstrations of both strength and valor
- It was justified to punish an act of evil, not a thought or feeling
