## General Information
The Red Wizards are exiles from Thay and are very powerful, evil wizards. Known for their crimson robes and arcane sigils tattooed on their shaved head, these wizards are known throughout Faer√ªn. The Red Wizards carry with them an evil reputation and are usually arrested or killed if spotted so they often travel quietly. Common folk don't know much about the Red Wizards history, just the evil they have done.
