## General Information
The Chromatic Dragons are generally regarded as evil, greed, arrogant, and territorial. Most people that come face to face with these creatures usually don't live long enough to tell the tale of their encounters. These beast can be identified by their solid and non-reflective scales. Like [[Metallic Dragons]], they keep hoards of treasure, but instead of out of curiosity, they hoard out of greed.
