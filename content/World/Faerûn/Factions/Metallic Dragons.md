## General Information
To the common folk, not much is known about the Metallic Dragons. Similar to Chromatic Dragons, they can keep large hoards of treasure stored in their lairs. However, these hoards come from unclaimed relics out of curiosity, investigation, and collection. Metallic Dragons are also known to be, in general, good and righteous creatures are distinguished by the color and compositions of their scales; their scales look like various metals.

> [!NOTE] Character Creation
> No, your character's race cannot be a dragon. The reason this is in here is for dragon derivative races such as Dragonborn and Half-Dragons which you can use (Half-Dragons are not in the PHB). Talk to me for more information on Metallic Dragons.
