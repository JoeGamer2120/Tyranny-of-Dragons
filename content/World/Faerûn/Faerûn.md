# Factions

## The Harpers
The Harpers are a secret organization whose power has waxed and wanned throughout Faerûn's history. The Harpers have been dissolved and reformed many times, each time creating varying goals. The latest incarnation of the group has its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality. The Harpers preferred course of action to accomplish its goals is that of secrecy and knowledge, not of fame and brute force.

## The Order of the Gauntlet
Similar to The Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet wishes to see justice and equality across Faerûn however, the methods and attitudes of each faction are very different. Where The Harpers preferred secrecy, bearers of the Gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice. The Order never hides in the shadows. The attitude of the Order is that evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day to embolden others to also fight evil.

## The Emerald Enclave
The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining the balance in the natural order and combatting forces that poses a threat to it. The Enclave is most well known for it's benevolent deeds and feared for its swift actions against those responsible for crimes against nature. Most of the Enclave's members live in the wilderness or small communities so they have very little representatives in towns and cities. However, they are not opposed to civilization; they seek to prevent civilization and the wilderness from harming one another. Many members of the Emerald Enclave are Druids, rangers, and bards but its numbers are not only made of these classes. It's open to anyone who values the natural order and neutrality.

## The Lords' Alliance
The Lords' Alliance is an organization created and led by leaders and nobles across Faerûn. Many of the members of the Lords' Alliance have conflicting goals and long-standing rivalries, however despite this, they band together in face of events to large for any of them to handle on their own. The Lords' Alliance is viewed in many extremes, some view it as the most secure governing bodies in the west, and some view it as nothing more than an organization of aggressive, self-serving figureheads. While both have some truth, ultimately, the Lords' Alliance all believe in the preservation of civilization for the bettering of society.

## The Zhentarim
As known as the Black Network, the Zhentarim are best known by the common folk for providing the *best* guards or mercenaries money can buy no matter how morally ambiguous the cause is. However, at the heart of the Zhentarim is an evil group of leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's  reach into every evil act: assassination, black markets, and illegal drug deals. The Zhentarim have far reaching connection spanning across Faerûn. Many members of the Zhentarim are rouges, thieves, assassins and evil wizards and many of its members serve the dark gods Bane and Cyric.
