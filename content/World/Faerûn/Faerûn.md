# Factions

## The Harpers
The Harpers are a secret organization whose power has waxed and wanned throughout Faer没n's history. The Harpers have been dissolved and reformed many times, each time creating varying goals. The latest incarnation of the group has its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faer没n, and promoting fairness and equality. The Harpers preferred course of action to accomplish its goals is that of secrecy and knowledge, not of fame and brute force.

## The Order of the Gauntlet
Similar to The Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet wishes to see justice and equality across Faer没n however, the methods and attitudes of each faction are very different. Where The Harpers preferred secrecy, bearers of the Gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice. The Order never hides in the shadows. The attitude of the Order is that evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day to embolden others to also fight evil.
