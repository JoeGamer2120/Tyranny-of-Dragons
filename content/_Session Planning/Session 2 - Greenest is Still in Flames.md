# Recap
Our adventures arrived in the trading town of [[Greenest]] in a normal spring night. However, things did not go according to plan when a band of cultist attacked the town. Large numbers of kobolds and humanoids are laying waste to the town accompanied by the presence of a blue dragon circling above the keep in the center of the city. After helping the bartender of The Greenest Tree and a family of citizens escape from attacking kobolds and cultist, our group of adventures makes their way into the keep. Governor Nighthill, a human male who runs the city of Greenest, approaches the characters asking if they would lend assistance to the Greenest and her people. After some hesitation, the group accepts. Governor Nighthill gives each of them a very rare *potion of vitality* and sends them off to the town mill as an explosion ignites from the mill. The characters take down a pack of kobolds outside the mill, but upon entering are surprised attack by of band of cultist inside the mill. After a hard fought battle, they take down the foes. Our hero's pick back up after the final guard is struck and killed.

### Rewards

## Half-Dragon Champion (pg. 28)

### Special 1-on-1 Rules 
Speed Factor Initiative (DMG pg. 271)
You may attempt to target certain areas on a creature. If declared prior to an attack role, if the creature/player roles 5 higher than the AC of a creature, the attacks it's the declared area.
- Arm - On hit, make a strength saving throw of DC 10 or half damage taken, which ever is higher, on fail the weapon is dropped

- Eyes - On hit, creature is blinded for 1 turn (see blinded)

### Rewards/Outcome
When the player goes down, Cyanwrath will plunge his sword into the character inflicting a failed death saving throw to the player. A group of healers with healing kits and +4 to Wisdom will scramble to stabilize the dying character. Cyanwrath will release the last of the prisoners and begin marching away southeast

Governor Nighthill offers two potions of healing to the wounded character.
If the party did not offer to fight the Half-Dragon he will become upset and not offer anymore help for the evening.
## Stragglers
Several miles ahead, a smoke from a small fire can be seen, first indication of the stragglers

Seeking shelter, four human cultist and eight kobolds  sought shelter in a low spot between surrounding hills, where tall boulders have rolled into a loose jumble; the area offers little protection and make it easier to sneak up on the site.

The enemies are VERY distracted and are easily surprised should combat ensue. If any are captured see pp. 30-31 for details
