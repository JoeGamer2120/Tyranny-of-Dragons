# Backstory
Son of Ashmond, orphaned at 11. Younger brother of Hugo. Raised in the slums of BG, street smart bard with a sharp tongue. Was taught to play accordion by his mother and holds on to her accordion well after she passed away. The accordion is more than an instrument to him; it’s a piece of his mother's legacy, a constant reminder of where he came from and why he must keep pushing forward. Learned the ins and outs of the streets from his father — how to spot a pickpocket, read the ebb and flow of a crowd, and charm his way into places he had no right to be. His sharp tongue and natural charisma often got him out of trouble just as quickly as they got him into it. He would often use his bardic magic to weave stories, illusions, and songs, creating moments of wonder and escape for those around him. Now, with Hugo by his side, Rethan travels the world. They move from town to town, a pair of wandering charlatans, sowing the seeds of their invented deity wherever they go. Arlen plays his mother’s accordion with skill and passion, masking the pain of his past beneath melodies that make the heart swell and words that spark the imagination. He walks the line between good and evil, between truth and deception, trying to find his own way in a world that has given him so little.
