# Backstory
Raised in a commune to Savras until age 11. His only friend there was the cook, Friar Tuck, who was the only person there who treated him as a person rather than a means to an end. At age 11, fled to Baldur’s Gate. Taken in by Ashmond, four years later accidentally fried Ashmond with his radiant “gift”. Hugo is still unsure whether it was his own negligence or the will of some god that killed Ashmond, but both options bring shame and anger. Left home at that point with Ashmond’s biological son and attempted to join the Order of the Gauntlet. However, Louie came to collect an old debt of Ashmond’s that the brothers inherited, and Hugo was forced to desert as they fled, and have been together in a theatrical traveling religion troupe spreading Perjurianism and peddling fake magical items ever since. Perjurianism exists both to pay the bills and dishonor the gods. Arkay is an invention of Hugo, the fictitious god of the cycle of life and death.

After leaving Baldur’s gate Hugo and Arlen first headed for Neverwinter via Waterdeep, where they met a friendly bar keep, after narrowly escaping Waterdeep, they traveled to Neverwinter, improving their craft and formally establishing the tenants and virtues of Perjurianism, honing their act into a refined science and obtaining their first converts by the time they reached Neverwinter. From neverwinter they spent the next 3 years traveling to smaller towns and villages before finally finding themselves in Greenest 5 years after the death of Ashmond their journey began.
